# NOTES: Milestone 2

- our tester for m2_part1 might be wrong, passing in wrong value for 'key' (argument to querySelect)

- i think we have to flush/clear our indices[selected_col] after creating it?
    - otherwise, we keep adding on same baseIDs?
    - say, {Grade1 : [baseIDs]}
    - if we don't drop index...
        - {100 : [1]} -> {100 : [1,1]} -> {100: [1,1,1]} ... 
    - we decided to rebuild our index everytime right? so we need to clear out existing dictionary entries...

- minor fix in locate range, to account for invalid key,col pairs
