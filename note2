-maybe have update counter for Table and Indexer, independent values
-avoid dropping indices and rebuilding everything?

example of set of queries
1) insert 3 records
2) update first record & select it -> need to build
3) update third record & select it -> need to build
4) no update & select first record -> no need to rebuild

...but in current tester
it's updating one col at a time per record ... and does so for X times
